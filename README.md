## About me 🙋‍♂️
Hello, my name is Gabriel. I'm from Germany, to be more precise from the Münsterland in North Rhine-Westphalia. I am an absolute computer science fanatic and geek, I love everything that runs with binary. I'm always up for something new and that's what I stand for with my motto "You should never stop learning!".

## How it all began 🧒
I used to love working with batch (Windows scripts), I created my own scripts with over 1,000 lines. But at some point, I got bored and wanted to work with GUIs. And I have informed myself, I bought a book about Python, but then after a few pages I saw and said "Where are the classes, brackets and the semicolons?" on it I closed the book and until today I never opened it again. Then I informed myself again and came into contact with C#, and also bought a thick book about it. After the first few pages I knew that this is my language!

## My strengths 💪
My strengths are clearly defined, it's computer science. What my heart beats for.
- I have logical understanding
- I learn quickly
- I learn by my mistakes
- I can think in a structured way
- I am always ready to learn

## Why I Programming 👨‍💻
It's actually simple, I love to think logically and create something of my own, which then comes from me. You just feel like a magician, and I love that.

## Why I use C# ❤️
C# (called CSharp) is my choice, because this language is simply beginner-friendly and has a wonderful community, in addition, the language is known for Windows applications such as WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), and the associated FrontEnd language "XAML" (Extensible Application Markup Language).
I can only recommend C# with its friendly syntax to anyone who wants to start programming. In addition, the error descriptions are also very detailed. 
Oh yes, I should not forget. Unity runs with C#, that means you can even create games!

And even that I almost forgot, you can create your own API or website with C#....

The language is just WOW


# And now have fun and have a nice day ❤️
